# This initializer runs once when Rails boots, after all gems are loaded
# This is an alternative to using config.after_initialize in engine.rb
# Uncomment and use this if you prefer initializers over engine configuration

# Rails.application.config.after_initialize do
#   if defined?(Maglev)
#     # Your initialization code here
#     # This will run once when Maglev is loaded
#   end
